Exchange Security Restrictions Remover
======================================

Untested, since I cannot add my Exchange account...

A conversion of the bits in rustamabd's email-policy-patch that apply to a 4.1.2 Galaxy S III SecExchange and SecEmail *only*. Honestly, I suggest just using the original patcher from http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1117452 since it supports more APKs. However, for me, I only wanted (originally, when I thought I would be able to add my account) to be able to do it through Xposed.
